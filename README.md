# Trademark Search Application

The **Trademark Search Application** is a robust **React** based web app designed to provide comprehensive trademark data retrieval and filtering capabilities. Utilizing React for its dynamic UI, the application integrates Axios for seamless API communication with the **Trademarkia API**, ensuring efficient data fetching and error handling. The user interface is styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive design, and **Postman** is used for testing API endpoints to ensure reliability. The core functionality includes a search feature where users input queries that trigger API requests handled by the **performSearch** function in **api.js**, while the **App.js** component manages state updates, loading indicators, and error messages. The data is displayed in **TrademarkCard** components, which showcase trademark details such as images, names, statuses, and descriptions. Filter options, managed by the **Filter** component, allow users to refine search results by categories like owners, law firms, and attorneys, and the entire system is designed to deliver an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

These include selecting from a list of owners, law firms, and attorneys through checkboxes, allowing for a targeted search based on these entities. Additionally, users can filter results by trademark status, with options such as Registered, Pending, Abandoned, and other statuses, helping users to categorize and view trademarks according to their current processing state.

* Detailed Trademark Information: </br>
 Each trademark entry is presented with comprehensive details. This includes identification of the mark, the current owner, the registration number, registration date, status of the trademark, and a descriptive overview. This thorough information helps users understand each trademark's context and status effectively.
