# Trademark Search Application

The **Trademark Search Application** is a robust **React** based web app designed to provide comprehensive trademark data retrieval and filtering capabilities. Utilizing React for its dynamic UI, the application integrates Axios for seamless API communication with the **Trademarkia API**, ensuring efficient data fetching and error handling. The user interface is styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive design, and **Postman** is used for testing API endpoints to ensure reliability. The core functionality includes a search feature where users input queries that trigger API requests handled by the **performSearch** function in **api.js**, while the **App.js** component manages state updates, loading indicators, and error messages. The data is displayed in **TrademarkCard** components, which showcase trademark details such as images, names, statuses, and descriptions. Filter options, managed by the **Filter** component, allow users to refine search results by categories like owners, law firms, and attorneys, and the entire system is designed to deliver an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

* Search Functionality: </br>
Users can perform searches for trademarks by entering specific query terms. The application efficiently handles input by trimming any leading or trailing spaces from the search query to ensure accurate results. It then fetches and displays trademarks that closely match the entered search term, enhancing the search experience by focusing on relevant data.

* Filtering Options: </br>
To further refine search results, users can apply various filters. These include selecting from a list of owners, law firms, and attorneys through checkboxes, allowing for a targeted search based on these entities. Additionally, users can filter results by trademark status, with options such as Registered, Pending, Abandoned, and other statuses, helping users to categorize and view trademarks according to their current processing state.

* Detailed Trademark Information: </br>
 Each trademark entry is presented with comprehensive details. This includes identification of the mark, the current owner, the registration number, registration date, status of the trademark, and a descriptive overview. This thorough information helps users understand each trademark's context and status effectively.
 
* User-Friendly Interface: </br>
The application features a user-friendly interface that makes navigating search results and filters intuitive. The design emphasizes ease of use, ensuring users can effectively interact with the app without encountering difficulties.

## How It Works
* Search Component: Users input their search query into the search bar. This action triggers a request to the Trademarkia API to find trademarks that match the query.

* API Integration: The performSearch function in api.js handles this by sending a POST request to the Trademarkia API. This request includes the user‚Äôs search query along with any additional parameters needed for the search.

* Data Handling: Once the API responds, the App.js component processes the received data. It extracts the unique filter options (e.g., owners, law firms, attorneys, and statuses) from the search results and updates the component‚Äôs state accordingly.

* Filtering: Users can then apply filters using the Filter component. This component allows them to refine the search results based on criteria such as owners, law firms, attorneys, and trademark statuses (e.g., Registered, Pending, Abandoned). The application dynamically updates the results based on these filters.

* Display: The filtered trademark data is rendered by the Cards component. Each card presents the trademark information in a structured format, including an image, details such as the mark‚Äôs name, current owner, registration number, registration date, status, and a brief description.
